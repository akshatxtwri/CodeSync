CodeSync - Realtime Collaborative Code Editor
CodeSync is a powerful, real-time collaborative code editor built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and WebSocket (Socket.IO) for seamless communication. This project allows multiple users to join a shared room and edit the same code simultaneously — ideal for live coding interviews, remote pair programming, and collaborative development.

🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js (with CodeMirror v6 for rich code editing)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

WebSocket: Socket.IO for real-time synchronization
